- question: My goal for making this custom Oauth2.0 is that I have external app written in react for frontend running on port 5173 and backend in java using spring boot I want to login in this external app which is running on 5173 using this customOAuth2 right now when i click login/open of react app running on 5173 its should be redirecting to custom Oauth login page once login is verified from there, then it should redirect to default page of external app which is running on 5173, and there can be 1000 of external web app
is its possible?

# Ans: 
Short answer: Yes, absolutely possible—and you don’t need to hard-code any frontend URLs inside the Authorization Server. The clean way to support “1 to 1000 external React apps” is to let each app’s own backend be the OAuth client and let OAuth do the redirecting based on each app’s registered redirect_uri.
Below is a battle-tested setup that scales to many apps without changing your Authorization Server (AS) code.

**The architecture that works (and scales)**
A. Option A (recommended): BFF pattern (Backend-For-Frontend)
1. Each external app consists of:
    - React SPA on http://appX-frontend:5173
    - Java Spring Boot backend on http://appX-backend:808X (this backend is the OAuth client)
- User clicks “Login” in the SPA → browser goes to the backend (/oauth2/authorization/your-as).
- Backend redirects the user to your Authorization Server (/oauth2/authorize?...).
- After login at AS, AS redirects back to the backend’s redirect_uri (e.g., http://appX-backend:808X/login/oauth2/code/your-as).
- Backend completes the code exchange, stores session, and then redirects the browser to the app’s default page (e.g., / on the same backend origin, or it can proxy/serve your SPA).
- AS does not need to know anything about where your SPA lives; it only uses redirect_uri supplied by each client (the backend) and registered for that client.

2. Why this is ideal for 1000 apps
- Each app registers its own client (via Admin API or Dynamic Client Registration).
- Each app has its own redirect_uri pointing to its own backend.
- The AS never contains any per-app URLs. No code changes when you add a new app.

B. Option B (pure SPA) with PKCE
- SPA talks to AS directly (no backend) and exchanges the code using PKCE.
- Works, but you must allow CORS to AS /token, manage tokens in the browser, and handle silent refresh or token rotation.
- For large fleets / higher security, BFF is usually cleaner.

**Exact wiring for one external app (BFF)**
1. Register the external app as a client in your AS You can use your Admin API or DCR. Example Admin API (what you already have): curl
```
curl -u admin:admin123 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "clientId": "my-web-app",
    "clientName": "My Web App",
    "redirectUris": ["http://localhost:8082/login/oauth2/code/my-as"],
    "grantTypes": ["authorization_code","refresh_token"],
    "scopes": ["openid","profile","email","api.read"],
    "publicClient": false,
    "clientSecret": "my-web-app-secret"
  }' \
  http://localhost:9000/admin/clients
```
- For 1000 apps you’ll either (a) bulk seed them or (b) enable Dynamic Client Registration so each team can self-register with approved defaults.

2. Configure the external app’s backend (Spring Boot at :8082) as an OAuth client
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
## Application.yml
```
server:
  port: 8082

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          my-as:                      # your registrationId
            client-id: my-web-app     # from the AS registration above
            client-secret: my-web-app-secret
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: "{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}"
            scope: openid,profile,email,api.read
        provider:
          my-as:
            issuer-uri: http://localhost:9000   # your Authorization Server issuer
```

# Security config(Backend)
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

  @Bean
  SecurityFilterChain app(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
      .authorizeHttpRequests(reg -> reg
        .requestMatchers("/", "/assets/**", "/favicon.ico").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
      )
      .oauth2Login(o -> o
        // This is the URL that starts the flow from the backend:
        // GET http://localhost:8082/oauth2/authorization/my-as
        // After success, you can let Spring redirect to "/" (default) or set a target:
        .defaultSuccessUrl("/", /* always */ false)
      )
      .logout(l -> l.logoutSuccessUrl("/"))
      .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable()); // or set up CSRF as you like for your app

    return http.build();
  }
}
```

**How the SPA button triggers login (frontend at :5173)**
The SPA should send the browser to the backend start URL: window.location.assign("http://localhost:8082/oauth2/authorization/my-as");

- From here, the backend redirects to the AS, the user logs in, and the AS returns to the backend’s redirect_uri. The backend completes the code exchange and then redirects to / (or your app’s default) — all without the AS knowing your SPA URL.
If your SPA is being served separately at :5173, you can:
- Serve the SPA through the backend (proxy/static) so redirects land on the same origin, or
- After successful login, the backend sends a 302 to http://localhost:5173/ (your default page). That redirect is done by the backend, not the AS. If you don’t want to hard-code in code, read the target from config/env per app.

**How the AS remains generic for all apps**
- Do not set any default success URL in the Authorization Server. Use Spring’s SavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler (the default) so that after login it resumes the saved /oauth2/authorize?... and then the AS redirects to the redirect_uri provided by the client (the external app backend). That’s how you naturally land back in the right app, with zero AS hard-coding.
- Ensure unauthenticated hits to /oauth2/authorize are sent to your custom login page (/auth/login), which you’ve already done.
- For users who open /auth/login directly (no OAuth flow), send them to a neutral /landing inside the AS after login so you don’t fall into /error. This doesn’t affect the normal OAuth flow started by /oauth2/authorize.
(You already have these parts; I’m just confirming the “why”.)

**Want to support a lot of apps? Enable DCR (Dynamic Client Registration)**
- Keep a short policy: allowed grant types, default scopes, token TTLs, etc.
- Require an initial access token (IAT) to call /connect/register.
- Each app team registers their backend URL as redirect_uris and gets back a client_id (+ secret for confidential apps).
- No AS code change per app; just operational policy.

**Example DCR call (from earlier)**
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/connect/register \
  -H 'X-Initial-Access: Bearer dev-dcr-token-123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "client_name": "Team Alpha Web",
    "redirect_uris": ["http://alpha-backend:8080/login/oauth2/code/my-as"],
    "grant_types": ["authorization_code","refresh_token"],
    "response_types": ["code"],
    "scope": "openid profile email api.read",
    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic"
  }'
```
**Common pitfalls to avoid**
- redirect_uri mismatch: it must match exactly what you registered (hostname, port, scheme, path).
- Don’t mix localhost and 127.0.0.1 between registration and actual request.
- Cookies / SameSite: if you plan to use cookies across origins, use HTTPS and set proper attributes. For a local demo, the BFF pattern keeps auth cookies on the backend origin so you’re safe.
- Time skew can break JWTs; keep dev machines’ clocks in sync.

# TL;DR

Yes, logging into an external app (port 5173) using your custom OAuth2.0 is not only possible—it’s the standard flow.

Let each app’s backend be the OAuth client with its own redirect_uri. The Authorization Server uses that to send the browser back to the right place. No AS hard-coding needed, even for 1000 apps.

Use DCR or your Admin API to register clients at scale.

If you want, I can give you a ready-to-run sample of the external app’s backend (8082) with a minimal controller and the FE “Login” button that starts the flow the right way.
